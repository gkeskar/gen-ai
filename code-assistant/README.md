- **Development patterns** and team collaboration insights

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- OpenAI API key
- Git (for history analysis features)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gkeskar/gen-ai.git
cd gen-ai
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the project root (3 levels up from this directory):
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### Usage

1. **Start the application:**
```bash
python code_assistant.py
```

2. **Open your browser:**
Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:7860`

3. **Analyze code:**
   - Enter the file path (relative or absolute)
   - Optionally add a task description
   - Check "Git Diff" to see what changed
   - Check "Commit History" to see how the file evolved
   - Click "🚀 Analyze Code"

## 📖 Example Usage

### Learning a New Language

**Scenario:** You're a Python developer learning Ruby

```
File Path: /path/to/ruby/orchestrator.rb
Task Description: Understanding Ruby ETL pipeline implementation
Options: ☐ Git Diff  ☐ Commit History
```

**Output includes:**
- Ruby language concepts explained with Python comparisons
- How classes, modules, and instance variables work
- Common Ruby patterns and idioms
- Detailed code walkthrough

### Documenting for Pull Requests

**Scenario:** You need to create PR documentation

```
File Path: app/services/payment_processor.py
Task Description: Added Stripe payment integration
Options: ☑ Git Diff  ☐ Commit History
```

**Output includes:**
- Summary of changes
- Technical implementation details
- Testing recommendations
- Risk assessment

### Understanding Code Evolution

**Scenario:** Understanding how a critical file evolved

```
File Path: core/authentication.js
Task Description: Review authentication system changes
Options: ☑ Git Diff  ☑ Commit History
```

**Output includes:**
- Timeline of how the file changed
- Key development milestones
- Why changes were made (from commit messages)
- Recent diff analysis with historical context
